# Laptop

### Laptop definition

A laptop computer or notebook computer, also known as a [laptop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop) or notebook, is a small, portable personal computer (PC). Laptops typically have a clamshell form factor with a flat-panel screen on the inside of the upper lid and an alphanumeric keyboard and pointing device on the inside of the lower lid. 

Most of the computer's internal hardware is in the lower part, under the keyboard, although many modern laptops have a built-in webcam at the top of the screen, and some even feature a touchscreen display. In most cases, unlike tablet computers which run on mobile operating systems, laptops tend to run on desktop operating systems, which were originally developed for desktop computers.

### Types of laptops

Ultrabooks (The "Normal" Ones)
What: Thin, light (13-14"), great battery.
For: 95% of people. Students (like you, perfect for coding), office work, browsing, movies.
My take: This is the default. Powerful enough for most programming, but mobility is the priority.

Gaming Laptops / Mobile Workstations
What: Thick, heavy, powerful CPUs, and dedicated graphics cards (NVIDIA/AMD). Loud fans, terrible battery life.
For: Hardcore gaming or heavy professional work (3D rendering, high-end video editing, AI modeling).
My take: Only buy this if you need that graphics power. Total overkill and a pain to carry around campus otherwise.

2-in-1s (Convertibles / Hybrids)
What: Laptops with touchscreens that fold 360Â° or detach to become a tablet.
For: People who use a stylus a lot for notes or creative work.
My take: It's a compromise. They're heavier than an ultrabook and clumsier than a real tablet. Mostly a gimmick unless you love handwritten digital notes.

### Laptop Hardware

Laptop hardware refers to the physical components that make up a portable computer. These are the tangible parts of the system that you can see and touch, which collectively execute software and process data. This includes everything from the central processor and memory to the screen, keyboard, and the chassis that holds it all together. Unlike desktop computers, laptop hardware is highly integrated and miniaturized to fit into a compact, mobile form factor.

The primary challenge in laptop hardware design is balancing performance with power consumption and heat dissipation. Components are specifically engineered to be energy-efficient to maximize battery life, while also being robust enough to handle the physical stresses of travel. This optimization means that while laptop components (like CPUs and GPUs) share the same fundamental architecture as their desktop counterparts, they are often clocked at lower speeds or have different power profiles to manage thermals within a confined space.

Here is a list of the main laptop hardware components:

2.  [Random-Access Memory (RAM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory)
3.  Storage (Solid-State Drive or Hard Disk Drive)
4.  Motherboard
5.  Display (Screen)
6.  Battery
